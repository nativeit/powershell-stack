    PScribo

SYNOPSIS
    PScribo is a documentation framework for Windows PowerShell and PowerShell (Core).

DESCRIPTION
    PScribo is an open source project that implements a documentation domain-specific-language (DSL) for Windows
    Powershell. The latest version is available at https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo.

    PScribo provides a set of functions that make it easy to create a document-like structure within Powershell without
    having to handle individual output formatting. A document's layout and contents only need to defined once. After
    creation, the document can be exported to one or more formats simultaneously. For more detailed infomation on the
    documentation DSL, see about_PScriboDocument.

    Pscribo can export documentation in a variety of formats and currently supports creation of text, Html and Word
    formats. Additional "plugins" can be created to support future formats if required. For more detailed information
    on plugins, see about_PScriboPlugins.

    PScribo is available as a Powershell module and supported on both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell (Core).

CREATING A PSCRIBO DOCUMENT
    To start using PScribo, you need to either install the PScribo module in your Powershell module path or download
    the PScribo bundle.

OTHER EXAMPLES
    Included in the PScribo module (not the bundle) are some heavily documented example scripts in the .\Examples
    directory. For an index of the examples, see about_PScriboExamples.
