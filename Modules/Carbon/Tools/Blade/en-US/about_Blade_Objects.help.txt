SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains the Blade .NET objects.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    ## Blade.RunResult
    
    This is the object returned by `blade.ps1` when it finishes running all the tests. It 
    is also available via a special global variable Blade creates after each test run 
    called `$LastBladeResult`. By default, it is displayed like this: 

           Count Failures   Errors  Ignored Duration        
           ----- --------   ------  ------- --------        
               1        0        1        0 00:00:01.3621362

    It has the following properties:

     * `[int] Count`: the number of tests that were run.
     * `[TimeSpan] Duration`: the amount of time it took to run all the tests. This is 
       actually the sum of all the durations of each test, so this maybe less than the wall
       time Blade took to run.
     * `[Blade.TestResult[]] Errors`: all the tests that encountered terminating errors. 
       Non-terminating errors don't cause a test to fail.
     * `[Blade.TestResult[]] Failures`: all the tests that failed (i.e. whose assertions 
       failed).
     * `[int] IgnoredCount`: the number of tests that were ignored/not run.
     * `[Blade.TestResult[]] Passed`: all the tests that passed.

    ## Blade.TestResult

    A `Blade.TestResult` object represents an individual test that Blade ran. You usually 
    get these objects by passing the `-PassThru` switch to `blade.ps1`, or from the 
    `Errors`, `Failures`, or `Passed` properties on a `Blade.RunResult` objects (returned 
    by `blade.ps1` when it finishes running tests). It has the following properties:

     * `[TimeSpan] Duration`: the amount of time the test took.
     * `System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord Error`: the terminating error thrown by 
       the test, if any,
     * `Blade.AssertionException Failure`: the assertion failure thrown by the test, if 
       any.
     * `[string] FixtureName`: the name of the script file the test was in.
     * `[string] Name`: the name of the test's function.
     * `[object[]] Output`: any output returned by the test function.
     * `[bool] Passed`: `$true` if the test passed; $false otherwise. A test fails when it
       throws a terminating exception or one of Blade's assert functions fails (e.g. throws
       a `Blade.AssertionException`.
     * `[DateTime] StartedAt`: the date/time the test started.
