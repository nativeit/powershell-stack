SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This topic describes how to contribute to the Carbon project.
    
LONG DESCRIPTION
    We welcome your feedback and contributions!

    Write tests with Pester. Tests go in the `Tests` directory. Tests should always 
    clean-up after themselves and strive to leave an operating system in the exact state 
    it was in before the test fixture ran. 
    
    Unfortunately, we only have the resources to run our tests on a 64-bit Windows 2012 R2
    and 7 computer. Any donations to the project would be used to purchase licenses and 
    hosting for running our tests on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows 
    2008 R2, and Windows 2012 R2.
 
    Carbon uses semantic versioning (see http://semver.org/). Carbon version numbers 
    take the form X.Y.Z: X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the 
    patch version. The patch version is incremented when backwards-compatible bug 
    fixes are made. You should feel comfortable rolling out a new patch version 
    quickly, with limited testing. The minor version is incremented when new, 
    backwards-compatible changes are introduced, or existing functions are deprecated.  
    You'll probably want to review the release notes and test those bits that changed 
    since the last release. The major version is incremented when 
    backwards-incompatible changes are made. In this case, you'll need to do thorough 
    testing, and upgrade your scripts to use new functionality. 

STYLE GUIDE
 
    We use spaces for indenting.  Each level of indent (i.e. "tab") should be four spaces. 
    This is default in the PowerShell ISE.
    
    Use camel-casing for all function names, including abbreviations three letters or 
    longer, e.g. Install-CMsmq, Install-CIisWebsite. Capitalize all letters in one or two 
    letter abbreviations, e.g. Test-COSIs32Bit.
    
    All function parameter and module variables names must be capitalized, e.g. `$Path`, 
    `$Name`, etc. All variable names should be lowercase, e.g. `$result`, `$csprojXml`.
    
    Variables that contain a path should end in `Path`, e.g. $csprojPath, $websitePath.
    
    *Always* use an [approved PowerShell verb](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms714428.aspx).
    
    If possible, use an [approved PowerShell parameter name](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd878352(v=vs.85).aspx).
      
    Use a prefix for all functions that manage a common area of Windows, e.g. Iis for all 
    IIS-related functions, Msmq for MSMQ-related functions, etc.
    
    All functions must have synopsis, description, and example documentation.
